## PyNMF - Python Non-Negative Matrix Factorization

### What is PyNMF?
Python Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (PyNMF) is a module for several constrained/unconstrained non-negative matrix factorization (and related) methods for both sparse and dense matrrices. 

It requires cvxopt, numpy, and scipy.

PyNMF currently includes the following methods:
* Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
* Versatile sparse non-negative matrix factorization (VSNMF)
* Orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization (ONMF)
